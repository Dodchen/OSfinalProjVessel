This is a final project in OS course, the project simulates a sailing vessel(thread), the vessel leaves Haifa and reaches the Suez Canal(one way pipe) when it reaches the thread enter to a waiting state, it passes through a canal and a new thread with the same vessel number is created. it sails towards the port of Eilat, where it receives cargo and unloads it. Once it finishes the unloading process, it goes back to Haifa(through another one way pipe).

feel free to contact me for more info.
